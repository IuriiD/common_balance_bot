# 'SharedExpensesBot' / Chatbot that helps to track shared expenses on the go
<p>
    Demo version for Telegram and more details will be soon ;)
</p>
<p>
    The idea for this training miniproject was suggested by my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/viktor.dziuban">brother</a> who said that it would be nice to have a chatbot that could help to track shared expenses during travels with friends.
    For example, when one pays for apartment, someone else for dinner, the 3rd one for gas, another food/drinks/tickets etc (as an alternative to chipping in with equal sums each time).
